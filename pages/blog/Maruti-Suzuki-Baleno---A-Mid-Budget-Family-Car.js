                    <p>One of the top automotive companies in India, Maruti Suzuki India Limited, produces the well-known hatchback car known as the Maruti Suzuki Baleno. The Baleno was initially introduced in India in 2015, and since then, it has grown significantly in popularity thanks to its chic appearance, roomy cabin, and fuel-efficient capabilities. In addition to the sedan versions of the Aerio and SX4 in Indonesia, the "Baleno" nameplate had been used on the Cultus Crescent in many regions. Also, the top-tier Baleno model, the Maruti Suzuki Baleno Alpha, comes with a number of high-end features and improvements.

                    <p>Although the new engine achieves an astounding mileage of 22.35 km/l with the manual gearbox and 22.94 km/l with the AMT, making the Maruti Baleno the most fuel-efficient premium hatchback in India, you probably won't miss the hybrid technology or even the earlier Baleno's diesel engine.
                        These numbers can be attributed to the idle engine start/stop mechanism, which shuts off the engine when the gearbox is in neutral but restarts it as soon as the clutch pedal is depressed. Due to its economical city-slicker nature, the Baleno can also transform into a respectably quick vehicle on the highways.

                        With this combination, Maruti struck gold as the Baleno blazed through the sales charts and swiftly rose to the top of the list of best-selling premium hatchbacks in India. The Baleno was modified by the firm in 2022 after more than 10 lakh units had been sold since 2015. The new vehicle was even more successful and went on to become India's best-selling vehicle for a brief period of time.
