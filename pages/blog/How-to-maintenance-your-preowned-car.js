                <span class="font-bold">1. Cost Savings:</span> According to new
                car prices, preowned cars are priced lower than the original
                price. This allows buyers to save money by choosing a preowned
                car, making it a budget-friendly choice.

                <span class="font-bold">2. Depreciation Avoidance:</span> New
                cars typically experience rapid depreciation during the first
                few years. Buying a preowned car allows you to avoid much of
                this initial depreciation, as it has already occurred.

                preowned car opens up a range of options, including models that
                may not be in stock or produced by manufacturers currently. This
                process helps you find a vehicle that suits your budget,

                New cars can lose significant value with even minor damage.
                Preowned cars may have already experienced some wear and tear,
                making minor cosmetic imperfections less financially impactful.

                Preowned cars are available immediately, unlike new cars. This
                means you can get the car shortly after completing the
                purchasing process.

                Registration fees are based on the price of the car. As preowned
                cars have a lower value, the registration fees are also reduced,
                providing additional cost savings.
